Haskell Web App Example

An example web app implemented in the haskell programming language.

This uses WARP web server, which implements WAI as a general interface for web applications. 

WARP and WAI by themselves don't use a lot of dependencies. But WAI-Extra does. It's a pretty necessary addition for things like delivering GZipped content, logging, and JSON handling.
